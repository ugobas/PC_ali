(It includes a modified version of the needlemanwunsch aligner programmed by Dr. Andrew C. R. Martin in the Profit suite of programs, (c) SciTech Software 1993-2007)

PC_ali performs hybrid multiple structure and sequence alignments based on the structure+sequence similarity score PC_sim. Besides the MSA, it outputs pairwise similarity scores and divergence scores and neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree obtained with the hybrid evolutionary divergence measure based on PC_sim, and it outputs a pdb file with multiply superimposed structures. Optionally, it computes violations of the molecular clock for each pair of proteins.

PC_ali takes as input:
1) either a list of PDB files (option -pdblist, format: column1: pdb code or file name col2: chain col3: domain, ex. 1-222 col4: domain name col5: directory 1 or 2 where the file is stored), or
2) not aligned sequences (option -seq), or
3) an MSA (option -ali).
In cases 2 and 3 PDB code or file name must be specified as sequence names.
In case 1, the PDB files may be stored in two different folders. Folder 1 is input as -pdbdir, folder 2 is input as -pdbdir2, the folder of each PDB file (1 or 2) is specified in the 3rd column of the pdblist file (optional), default is folder 1. 
It is not allowed to input both a list of PDB files and an MSA.

Usage:
PC_ali   -pdblist <List of PDB files> Format: 1 file_name 2 chain 3 dir 
	 -seq <sequences in FASTA format, with names of PDB files>
	 -ali <MSA file in FASTA format, with names of PDB files>
	# The pdb code is optionally followed by the chain index
	# Ex: >1opd.pdb A or >1opdA or >1opd_A

	 -pbdir <folder of pdb files>  (default: current directory)
	 -pbdir2 <2nd folder of pdb files>  (default: current directory)
	 -pdbext <extension of pdb files>  (default: .pdb)
#### Optional parameters:
         -id Print statistics of conservation and changes (.id)
	 -out <Name of output files> (default: alignment file)
	 -clique     ! Initial alignment is based on cliques (may be slow)
	 -ali_tm     ! Perform pairwise alignments that target TM score
	 -ali_co     ! Perform pairwise alignments that target Contact Overlap
	 -ali_ss     ! Perform alignments that target sec.structure
	 -ss_mult    ! alignments that target sec.structure are MSA
	 -shift_max <Maximum shift for targeting sec.str.>
	 -print_pdb    ! Print structure superimposition in PDB format
	 -print_sim    ! Print similarity measures for pairs of proteins
	 -print_div    ! Print divergence measures for pairs of proteins
	 -print_cv     ! Print molecular clock violations
	 -func <file with function similarity for pairs of proteins>

Computed similarity measures:
(1) Aligned fraction ali,
(2) Sequence identity SI,
(3) Contact overlap CO,
(4) TM-score TM (Zhang & Skolnick Proteins 2004 57:702)
(5) PC_sim, based on the main Principal Component of the four above similarity scores
They are printed in <>.prot.sim for all pairs of protein sequences, and also for multiple conformations of the same sequence (if present) if required with -print_sim

Computed divergence measures:
(1) Tajima-Nei divergence TN=-log((SI-S0)/(1-S0)) with S0=0.06 (Tajima F & Nei 1984, Mol Biol Evol 1:269),
(2) Contact_divergence CD=-log((q-q0(L))/(1-q0(L)) (Pascual-Garcia et al Proteins 2010 78:181-96),
(3) TM_divergence=-log((TM-TM0)/(1-TM0)), TM0=0.167.
(4) PC_divergence=-log((PC-PC0)/(1-PC0)), PC0 linear combination of S0, TM0, CO(L) and nali0=0.5.
They are printed in <>.prot.div for all pairs of protein sequences, and also for multiple conformations of the same sequence (if present) if required with -print_div

Flux of the program:
(1) In the modality -ali, the program starts from the pairwise alignments obtained from the input MSA. In the modality -seq the starting pairwise alignments are built internally.
(2) The program then modifies the pairwise alignments by targeting PC_sim. The similarity matrix is constructed recursively, using the input pairwise alignment for computing the shared contacts and the distance after optimal superimposition (maximizing the TM score) for all pairs of residues and obtaining a new alignments. Two iterations are usually enough for getting good results. Optionally, for the sake of comparison, the program can target the TM score (-ali_tm), the Contact Overlap (-ali_co) and the secondary structure superposition (-ali_ss).
(3) Then, the program builds the multiple alignment based on the maximal cliques of the pairwise alignments. This computation does not require neither a guide tree nor gap penalty parameters and in most cases it is faster than the progressive multiple alignment.
(4) Finally, the program runs iteratively progressive multiple alignments using as guide tree the average linkage tree obtained with the PC_Div divergence measure of the previous step and using as starting alignment the previous multiple alignment. The best MSA is selected as the one with the maximum value of the average PC similarity score.
(5) The program prints the optimal MSA and the Neighbor Joining tree obtained from the corresponding PC_Div divergence measure.
(6) Optionally, if -print_pdb is set, the program prints the multiple superimposition obtained by maximizing the TM score.
(7) Furthermore, if -print_cv is set, the program computes and prints for all four divergence measures the violations of the molecular clock averaged over all possible outgroups identified with the Neighbor-Joining criterion, and the corresponding significance score.

In the first pairwise phase, the program computes similarity and divergence scores for all pairs of protein structures. It then clusters all conformations of the same protein and computes the structural similarity (divergence) between two proteins as the maximum (minimum) across all the examined conformations.
The similarity and divergence scores are computed for the starting alignment, for the modified pairwise alignments that target different similarity scores (TM score, contact overlap and PC_sim) and for the best multiple alignment.
